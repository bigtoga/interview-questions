# Fundamentals of Statistics

Why is it productive to aggregate models?
   - Different models tend to overestimate and underestimate their predictions, so the differences frequently cancel out.
   
Which are methods used for validating models?
   - holdout testing data and cross-validation testing data
   
What is the purpose of model validation in data science?
   - to determine how well the statistical model works with data other than the data used for modeling
  
What is meant by a "feature" in the context of feature reduction?
   - A feature is a variable or dimension in the data

Which two techniques are the most common choices for dimensionality reduction?   
   - principal component analysis and factor analysis
   
## Outlier Detection

While anomaly detection is normally associated with negative outcomes like fraud or machine failure, can you think of any positive outcomes that could come from using anomaly detection on *business* data?
   - identifying new markets with potential value
   - Identifying high performing workers or customers

Which characteristic makes fraud detection particularly difficult?
   - Fraud is relatively rare
   
**When should I perform outlier detection **?
- During EDA 
- During model testing when you are getting unexpected results and have concerns about whether outliers are causing underfitting 

**What are some of the best strategies you have used for outlier detection?**

**Iâ€™ve found outliers - now what?**

**Whats the fastest way to spot outliers?** Initial EDA likely shows these with histograms, pair-wise plots, boxplots
   
   

Which two methods are common algorithms for classifying new cases into existing categories?
   - k-means and k-nearest neighbors
  
What is the name for a chart that shows "branches" or cases splitting from one, giant cluster, to individual clusters?
   - dendrogram
   
The technique of separating time-series data into and overall trend, a seasonal or cyclical trend, and random variations or noise is known by which term?
   - decomposition
  
What is meant by "autocorrelation" in time-series data?
   - Autocorrelation means that each point in time is influenced by the points that came before it.
  
Which are examples of models used in predictive analytics?
   - regression and neural networks
  
If you can only choose one number to describe a distribution, then you should choose a measure of center. But what should you choose if you can have a second number?
   - a measure of variability
