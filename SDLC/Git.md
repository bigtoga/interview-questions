**What is origin and when would you use it?**
- `origin` is a reference to the remote repo + branch you push/pull to/from (ie. sync with). If you cloned the repo, initially/by default, origin would refence the remote repo you cloned the repo from. Can easily change w --set-upstream origin {other_branch}
